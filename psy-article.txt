At some point during a career, most people have the misfortune of drawing the proverbial short straw.  Perhaps you were passed over for an assignment or promotion you absolutely believe should have been yours.  Or perhaps you were laid off through no fault of your own due to consolidation, a merger, downsizing, or the simple failure of the business you chose to join.
My own favorite short straw involves inheriting the “boss from hell”.  This reality often never stops causing pain.  Every day comes some new manifestation of poor management that gradually wears us down physically and emotionally.
No wonder in any of these situations we often feel like a victim. The feelings that usually accompany this state of mind are quite natural and understandable:  anger, frustration, defeatism, a sense of unfairness, depression, and perhaps worst of all, a feeling of impotence or sense that it is somehow our fault or just due.
To deny these feelings is foolish; we are only human after all.  But how long should we wallow in these negative emotions, entertain and encourage them, or share them with others?  NOT LONG, I say, if we know what is good for us.  An unrelenting victim’s mentality is an emotional black hole.  The longer it persists the deeper and darker our emotional state becomes and the more we are likely to feel paralyzed when it comes to doing something about it.
How does one escape or survive when there is no immediate exit from the situation in which you find yourself?  While I am no expert on such matters, I have always found two important steps a great way to begin.  Both are primarily mental, involve a different mind-set, and are absolutely within the realm of things we control.
